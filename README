course project -- Modeler

compile both in linux and windows

the provided files mat.h and vec.h
are problmatic, finally make it work after some tweaks

but the problems may arise in future cases, 
should completely solve them by ... writing mat.h and vec.h by yourself..!

------------------
Actually I wonder, are these files borrowed from opencv ?
